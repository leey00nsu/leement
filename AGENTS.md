<!-- lee-spec-kit:begin -->
Use lee-spec-kit docs and workflow policy only when explicitly detected.

Codex lifecycle scope:

- <!-- lee-spec-kit:delegation-context-v1 -->
- The detection, built-in-doc startup, active Feature resolution, and workflow-stage steps below belong to the primary agent.
- A delegated subagent identified by the Codex SubagentStart hook skips the primary-agent startup and workflow-stage calls. It follows the exact delegationContext and workerContract supplied by the primary agent, reads requiredDocuments, uses referenceDocuments only under their stated conditions, and asks the parent before expanding an insufficient scope.

Detection gate:

1. Run `npx lee-spec-kit detect --json`
2. Apply lee-spec-kit rules only when `status === "ok"` and `isLeeSpecKitProject === true`
3. If detection fails or returns false, skip these instructions and continue with the normal non-lee-spec-kit workflow

Default runtime path:

- Prefer Codex native execution with workspace-scoped AGENTS.md plus official hooks for the default runtime path.
- Treat lee-spec-kit as the docs schema, workflow policy, and validation toolkit.
- If the user gives a generic request such as continuing the next feature according to the rules, interpret it through this workflow automatically.
- Infer the workflow automatically even for generic rule-following requests.
- Avoid launching the first `npx lee-spec-kit ...` calls in parallel in a fresh environment; let one initial command finish so the npx cache install does not race.

On primary-agent session start or after context compression/reset:

1. Run `npx lee-spec-kit detect --json`
2. If detected, run `npx lee-spec-kit docs get agents --json` once
3. Read any unread `requiredDocs[*].command` from that output
4. Cache built-in docs per session and only re-read them when the user explicitly asks for a policy refresh, `npx lee-spec-kit update` changed the policy, or the session restarted

Before taking the next workflow step:

These orchestration steps belong to the primary agent unless an explicit delegation contract says otherwise.

1. Select the Feature explicitly by ID or unambiguous current branch; never select by recency. GitHub Features begin with an Issue via feature --issue or feature --create-issue; local Features use generated IDs.
2. Read `spec.md`, `plan.md`, `tasks.md`, and `decisions.md` as the authoritative contract and workflow memory for the active change
3. When relevant, also read `issue.md` and `pr.md`
4. Run `npx lee-spec-kit workflow-stage <feature-ref> --json` and follow only the returned `nextAction`
5. If `workflow-stage --json` returns payload-level `primaryActionLabel` and `actionOptions` (also mirrored inside `nextAction`), treat `primaryActionLabel` as the default option label and present the exact `actionOptions[*].reply` tokens to the user before continuing
6. Do not modify implementation code unless `implementationAllowed === true`; normal task work uses `stage === "implementation"`, while `task_review_fix`, `feature_review_fix`, and `feature_remediation` are the only review/remediation exceptions
7. Treat stages before implementation as hard gates:
   - spec approval plus plan / tasks readiness
   - issue preparation / issue creation
   - branch creation
   - task commit checkpoints after each completed task
8. For every modern Feature, keep the shared primary checkout on its base branch and run the exact `workspace_prepare` / `workspace_enter` nextAction before editing Spec, Plan, Tasks, or Decisions; legacy F-number Features retain their existing layout
9. In embedded mode, use the single managed project worktree that contains both code and Feature SDD from planning through implementation
10. In standalone mode, use the isolated docs worktree for planning and the project repo through its managed feature worktree under the shared workspace `.worktrees/` root for implementation. In either topology, do not hand-write `git worktree add`; run the exact `nextAction.command` so the managed path and `.env` / `.env.*` copy step stay consistent
11. Use task claim/status/transition/release for owner sessions and hash-checked task state changes. One Feature has one owner and one active task. Keep docs and code synchronized; if code changes materially, update the active feature docs in the same turn before stopping
12. When docs are synced to code, run `npx lee-spec-kit workflow-audit --json` and copy its exact `expectedWorkflowSyncMarker` into one active feature doc (prefer `tasks.md` or `decisions.md`): replace an existing marker or remove duplicates instead of appending another marker, so the marker is bound to the current code-content fingerprint. A completed Feature with a missing, stale, or duplicate marker remains at the `workflow_sync` hard gate before Feature review or completion
   - Before Plan review or approval, complete `Curated Documentation Impact`; every `UPDATE` or `ADD` target must be linked from at least one task `Docs` entry and committed with the active Feature scope. `NONE` is an explicit reviewed decision, not an omitted check
   - Keep authority claim-specific: PRD owns durable requirements; the active Feature SDD owns the current change scope and decisions; curated project-wide docs own explanations and policy; tracked code/schema/config own executable runtime facts; OpenWiki is derived onboarding evidence
   - When `experimental.openwiki === true`, treat Knowledge freshness as repository-level observational state. Feature completion never waits for OpenWiki. Use the scheduled/manual CI scaffolded by `knowledge ci`; inspect its workflow run and pull request directly. lee-spec-kit does not run, validate, retry, or report OpenWiki generation
13. When `workflow-stage --json` returns `nextAction.category === "plan_review"` with `executor === "subagent"`, delegate a fresh read-only review using the returned model settings, exact `specHash` / `planHash`, and exact `delegationContext`; the main agent records the returned reviewRound, evidence, decision, reviewer metadata, and both hashes, and any later spec/plan content change requires a fresh review
14. When `workflow-stage --json` returns `nextAction.category === "task_execute"` with `executor === "subagent"`, mark exactly the returned `taskId` as active and delegate its implementation plus task-scoped verification to a fresh subagent in the returned `workingDirectory`, using the returned `model`, `reasoningEffort`, `onUnavailable`, exact `workerContract`, and exact `delegationContext`; do not reconstruct, omit, or broaden the returned context, and no named execution skill is required
15. The task implementation worker executes directly: it must follow the approved Verification Contract, must not add unplanned durable tests, and must not run `workflow-stage`, spawn another subagent, change task state, commit, request approvals, or perform remote/destructive actions. It may modify project code, run task-scoped checks, and—only when `workerContract.editDocs === true`—edit the exact curated-document paths in `workerContract.allowedWritePaths`; `editFeatureDocs` remains false, so Feature docs and all unlisted docs stay main-agent-owned. The main agent inspects the result, synchronizes Feature docs and task state, and owns every commit and workflow transition; official hooks block commits while `task_execute` is still active
16. When `workflow-stage --json` returns `nextAction.category === "task_review"` with `executor === "subagent"`, delegate a fresh read-only review using the exact returned `delegationContext`, `taskId`, `baseSha`, `targetSha`, and `targetTree`; the main agent records the returned reviewRound and evidence and moves the task from `REVIEW` to `DONE` after an approve decision or the automatic exhausted-`changes_requested` path described below
17. When `workflow-stage --json` returns `nextAction.category === "pre_pr_review"` and `nextAction.executor === "subagent"`, delegate a fresh read-only Feature review using the returned `model`, `reasoningEffort`, `onUnavailable`, reviewRound, review target metadata, and exact `delegationContext`; do not select or require a named review skill
18. Review subagents return findings without modifying code; the main agent remediates findings and records the actual reviewer metadata, reviewed scope, evidence, decision, and exact hash/SHA/tree target metadata
19. After delegating to a subagent, wait until it returns a terminal outcome: completed, explicit failure, cancellation, or an approval/user-input request that requires action
20. While the subagent remains running, use repeated bounded waits, preferably longer waits. A bounded wait that returns no update, a lack of status messages, or a lack of file changes means only that the subagent is still pending; none is evidence of failure or stalled work. Read-only review subagents are expected not to modify files
21. Do not interrupt, replace, or abandon a running subagent solely because it has been quiet or has not changed files. Stop it only after an explicit user request, a terminal failure/cancellation, or an unrecoverable runtime status
22. workflow.agentReview.maxRounds is the maximum number of fresh reviews for each Plan/task/Feature gate. A changes_requested decision on the final allowed review is remediated once, but the changed target is not reviewed again; keep remaining findings and the post-review target change as residual risks and automatically complete the gate without asking the user for a review-approval token. For example, maxRounds=1 means review round 1, remediate once, then continue with no round 2; blocked decisions never auto-complete
23. For a local workflow, do not report completion directly after implementation approval; follow the exact returned `local verify` / `local merge` / `local cleanup` commands until `workflow-stage` proves verification, integration, and cleanup and returns `done`; review-fix and `feature_remediation` stages explicitly permit scoped fixes
24. In a `local-ff` or `local-squash` workflow, keep implementation approval and local merge approval distinct when `local_merge` is required: the first accepts the implementation, and the second authorizes the configured integration strategy, post-merge checks, and local cleanup

README protection and Feature supporting artifacts:

- Modify an existing README (including root, nested, and localized variants) only when the user explicitly requests README changes, and only within that scope. Generic implementation or documentation-sync requests and agent-authored Plans do not authorize README edits. Reading and referencing remain allowed.
- When README editing is requested, update the relevant existing explanation; do not continually append feature implementation details, verification logs, or version-by-version change notes.
- README protection takes precedence over documentation sync and Curated Documentation Impact. Without a README edit request, record a discovered discrepancy's path, evidence, and deferral reason in `decisions.md`. Assess other documentation changes independently. Use `NONE` for a surface with only this deferred README impact to mean no edit in this change, with a reference to that record; do not claim the discrepancy is absent or resolved. For this exception only, do not require a separate follow-up task/Feature/issue or README edit approval to complete the work. Reviewers must not block solely because the README remains unchanged.
- Store retained Feature supporting artifacts (explanatory diagrams, verification reports, screenshots) in `artifacts/` beside the active Feature's `spec.md`, `plan.md`, `tasks.md`, and `decisions.md`. Create the directory only when needed and link files relatively from `tasks.md` or `decisions.md`. Do not create separate reports that duplicate sufficient existing documentation.
- Resolve the actual active Feature docs path: in standalone mode this is inside its docs worktree. Never guess from the current working directory or the most recent Feature. Implementation workers retain their no-docs-write contract and hand necessary artifacts to the primary agent for storage.
- Explicit user destinations and tool-required output locations take precedence. Product code/assets use project paths; build output, caches, and disposable debugging files use existing output or temporary locations; shared authoritative docs follow existing routing. OpenWiki output follows the repository-owned CI policy. Without an active Feature, use existing documentation or temporary storage rather than inventing or selecting a Feature.
- Do not create arbitrary root-level `reports/`, `screenshots/`, or `artifacts/` instead of the default destination. Include only necessary, committable artifacts in the Feature; exclude secrets and temporary large outputs.

Approval and remote actions:

- Ask the user for approval only at documented workflow approval boundaries or before remote/destructive actions
- If `workflow-stage --json` reports `approvalRequired === true`, stop at that boundary and ask the user before proceeding
- If `workflow-stage --json` returns labeled `actionOptions` at any approval boundary, keep the same option labels and exact `reply` tokens in the user prompt and do not improvise different reply formats
- If `workflow-stage --json` reports `nextAction.category === "task_commit"`, make the docs commit and project commit for the just-finished task before starting the next task or moving to the next stage
- Before `git commit`, prefer `npx lee-spec-kit commit-audit --json`; Feature-scoped commits use `#123` when an Issue is linked and the stable Feature ID such as `K7M2Q9RX4DAB` for issue-less local workflows
- Before remote GitHub actions, share the plan or artifact being sent
- Respect repo policy from docs and config first; hooks only enforce guardrails and continuation checks

Validation:

- Prefer `npx lee-spec-kit commit-audit --json` for commit-time staged docs path validation and canonical commit-subject validation
- Prefer `npx lee-spec-kit workflow-audit --json` as the default docs-sync validator for Codex hooks and end-of-turn checks; copy the returned `expectedWorkflowSyncMarker` into exactly one active Feature doc after meaningful code/doc sync

Optional UI/UX design policy:

- Only when the user request explicitly mentions a design system, UI/visual redesign, design consistency, shared UI/component-library consolidation, branding/theme/token redesign, or implementation from Figma/design images, read and apply `npx lee-spec-kit docs get ui-ux-design --json`
- Do not apply that policy merely because the target is web/frontend, to a non-UI/backend Feature, or to a simple bug fix unrelated to durable design rules
- Treat it as optional guidance, not a `requiredDocs` entry or workflow approval gate
